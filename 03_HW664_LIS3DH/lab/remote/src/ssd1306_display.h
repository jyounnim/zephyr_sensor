/*
 * ssd1306_display.h
 *
 * Minimal SSD1306 128x64 I2C text display driver, written raw against
 * the I2C API instead of Zephyr's in-tree display subsystem.
 *
 * Why raw I2C and not the official `solomon,ssd1306fb` driver + CFB:
 * this series' roadmap already root-caused a confirmed ESP32 Zephyr
 * I2C driver bug where multi-segment write transactions are not
 * reliably concatenated (see Lab 02 / parked SSD1306 I2C lab notes).
 * The official display driver issues the control byte and the pixel
 * payload as separate i2c messages, which reproduces that exact bug
 * on this SoC. This driver instead always merges the control byte and
 * the payload into ONE contiguous buffer and issues a single
 * `i2c_write()`, which is the workaround this series has already
 * validated on real hardware.
